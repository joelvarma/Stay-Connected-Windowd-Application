# Stay-Connected-Windows-Application
This app lets users know if their friends are within certain radius. This is developed as part of Microsoft's Windows App Development Program in 2014


So, the application is developed in C#. I used Mirosoft's Azure Cloud to store users data.

To give quick overview of the application, I used user's latitude longitude data and applied Haversine Algorithm to calculate
distance between two coordinates i.e users and his friends coordinates.
